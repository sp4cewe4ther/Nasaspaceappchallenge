<p>Did you know that, besides the weather we feel here on Earth—like rain, sun, or snow—there's also something called <em>space weather</em>? Yes! It happens far away, beyond the clouds, in space, and it all starts with our king of stars: the Sun!</p> <p>The Sun doesn't just give us light and heat. Sometimes, it also releases huge amounts of energy, like sneezing fire. These are called <strong>solar flares</strong> and <strong>coronal mass ejections</strong>, or CMEs. These events launch millions of super-fast particles and magnetic fields into space that travel all the way to our planet.</p> <p>We may not see them with our eyes, but when they reach Earth, they can cause many effects. It's like space has its own kind of invisible weather!</p> <p>And how does this space weather affect us? Well, it doesn't get us wet like rain or freeze us like snow, but it can cause some important things to stop working for a while: satellites, GPS, radio signals... and even electricity.</p> <p>Space weather isn't science fiction, it's real science! And even though we can't touch it, it can affect us. From astronauts traveling in space, to farmers, airplane pilots, electricity operators, and really... all of us!</p> <p>Want to see an example? Let's meet someone who lives with space weather every day...</p>

<p>Meet Don Pablo, a farmer with many years of experience working the land. He tells us: “Before, to know if it was a good time to plant, we only looked at the sky... now we also look into space.”</p> <p>Why? Because today, Don Pablo uses modern technology to work. Thanks to satellites, he can know when it's best to plant or harvest, depending on the weather. But if a strong solar storm occurs, those satellites can fail... and the information disappears as if by magic!</p> <p>“We also use GPS to drive the tractor very precisely,” says Don Pablo. “That way we plant in perfect lines. But if there's bad space weather, the GPS gets confused and the tractor can plant crookedly or in the wrong place.”</p> <p>That's why Don Pablo no longer just observes the clouds or the wind. He also keeps an eye on what's happening on the Sun. If there are large solar flares, he knows he has to be prepared for anything. </p> <p>Just like we carry umbrellas if it's going to rain, some farmers prepare for solar storms!</p>

    <p>One clear day, a young pilot was preparing for a special flight to France. As always, she carefully checked the wheels, engines, and all the controls. The sky looked calm, but the control tower warned her of something important: the Sun was very active, and that could cause <strong>space weather</strong>.</p>
    <p>What does that mean? The Sun had released a large amount of energy and particles into space, as if it had made a huge explosion of light. Although this happens very far away, it can affect flights that go very high or near the Earth's poles.</p>
    <p>The pilot listened attentively. They explained to her that this type of weather can interfere with <strong>GPS</strong> and <strong>communications</strong> systems. If that happens, it's harder to accurately determine the route or receive clear instructions from the ground.</p>
    <p>She also learned that, in those conditions, radiation can increase at high altitudes, so it's important to follow safe routes and keep a close eye on the sky.</p>
    <p>A weather expert appeared to explain that it's not just wind, rain, or heat that influences flight. What happens in space is also important for those who travel through the skies.</p>
    <p>With that information, the pilot adjusted her flight plan. She knew that with care, good communication, and the help of experts, she could continue flying safely.</p>
    <p>This is how she discovered that the Sun not only heats the Earth, it can also affect what happens high in the sky... and that knowing space weather is part of being a great pilot.</p>

     <p>Far from Earth, astronauts travel in their spaceships, exploring the universe. From up there, they can see our planet as a blue marble floating in space.</p>
     <p>But there's something invisible that can harm them if they're not careful: <strong>space weather</strong>. And what is that? It's explosions and winds coming from the Sun, full of energy and fast-moving particles, like the Sun sneezing really hard.</p>
     <p>When that happens, astronauts can be hit by <strong>dangerous rays</strong> called radiation. Since there are no clouds or air to protect them up there, they need to wear their <strong>special suits</strong> and stay inside the ship to be safe, just like you stay inside your house during a storm.</p>
     <p>These rays from the Sun can also <strong>damage the ship's controls</strong> or cause the communication and navigation systems to stop working for a while. That's why astronauts have to be very alert and change their plans if space weather becomes dangerous.</p>
     <p>Even if it seems like nothing's happening in space... there's a lot to keep in mind! But with preparation and care, astronauts like Leo can continue their work.</p>

  <div class="texto5">
     <p>Here on Earth, there are very important people working to keep your home, school, and hospitals powered. They are the <strong>electrical grid operators</strong>. They are like invisible heroes of electricity!</p>
     <p>But sometimes, <strong>space weather</strong> also complicates their work. When the Sun unleashes a huge energy storm, some <strong>invisible particles</strong> travel to Earth and play tricks on the power lines.</p>
     <p>These particles can cause <strong>transformers</strong> to become very hot, as if they develop a fever, or cause the lines to receive more electricity than they can handle. Then, some parts of the city may lose power.</p>
     <p>In addition, operators use <strong>satellites and GPS</strong> to know which parts need help. But when there's severe space weather, those satellites can fail or even stop working for a moment!</p>
     <p>That's why operators have to be prepared, just like a firefighter or a doctor. They're always ready to fix whatever's broken and keep the power on, even when the sun is playing tricks far, far away.</p>
     <p>Thanks to them, we can have reliable electricity every day, even when space weather is playing tricks on us. </p>

     <p>Estefany, a young woman very connected to technology, tells us: “One day I woke up and nothing was working. The internet was down, the GPS was taking me to the wrong places, and I couldn't make calls.”</p>
     <p>At first, she thought it was a problem with the phone company, but then she heard on the news that a solar storm was affecting the satellites we use every day.</p>
     <p>“I never imagined that the Sun, so far away, could change my daily life,” says Estefany. “That day, millions of people were in trouble: from pilots to farmers.”</p>
     <p>At night, she went out to look at the sky. “I saw green and pink lights dancing… my mom told me it was the Northern Lights. It was magical.”</p>
     <p>That's how she understood that space weather can cause failures, but also give us wonders. The Sun not only gives us light and heat: it also <strong>connects</strong> us to the universe in surprising ways.</p>
